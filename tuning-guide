Guidelines for Tuning

Step

Higher Step → faster backtest, fewer comparisons

Lower Step → more precise pattern matching, higher CPU load

BarsPerPattern

Shorter patterns → lighter computation, faster response

Longer patterns → captures more complex trends, slightly slower

HistoryLimit

Limit the number of historical bars compared to avoid unnecessary CPU load

For intraday (M1–M5) → 500–1000 bars

For longer timeframes (H1–D1) → 200–1000 bars depending on dataset

CPU Load Estimation

Approx. 20k–40k operations per tick is light for modern CPUs

200k ops/tick may cause lag in MT4/MT5, especially on M1 tick data

Visualization

Pattern lines redraw only once per new bar, so higher Step doesn’t affect chart performance
